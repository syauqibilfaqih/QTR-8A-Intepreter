This is the repository of QTR-8A Interpreter circuit that supports both digital data transmission through gpio pins and UART communication between master microcontroller and slave microcontroller, which is Arduino Nano, to read the QTR-8A sensor data. Use KiCad to open the schematic and board file, whereas use PlatformIO VS Code to open the code and build it.
